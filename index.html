    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>I got my first taste of programming while wrangling Excel macros for a plant nursery, and never looked back. Now I'm enrolled in App Academy, training for a career in full-stack web development. My prior experience has given me a sharp eye for detail and a dual passion for documentation and project management.</p>
